# React Data Fetching Practice

## Description

This project is a React application focused on practicing data fetching from a public API. The app fetches data from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and displays it in a table format. The project consists of several components, each with a distinct role:

1. **App**: The parent component where the main state is managed.
2. **Table**: A component that renders the fetched data in a table.
3. **Row**: Represents a row in the table.
4. **Cell**: Represents a cell in a table row.
> **Note**: In this project, a 'Row' is understood as a single object fetched from the API, and a 'Cell' represents a single property of that object.

## Features

- **Fetch Data**: Fetch data from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).
- **Display in Table**: Data is displayed in a table for easy reading.
- **Data Flattening**: The fetched data is flattened out to display relevant information concisely.
